           Grande began her music career at age 15 in the 2008 Broadway musical 13. 
           She rose to fame for playing Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series Victorious (2010–2013) and Sam & Cat (2013–2014).
           Grande signed with Republic Records in 2011 after label executives viewed YouTube videos of her covering songs. 
           Her 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B debut album,[2] Yours Truly (2013), topped the US Billboard 200, while its lead single, "The Way", reached the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100. Grande's voice and whistle register on the album drew immediate comparisons to Mariah Carey.

           She continued to explore pop and R&B in her second and third studio albums, My Everything (2014) and Dangerous Woman (2016).
           My Everything experimented with EDM and achieved global success with its singles "Problem", "Break Free" and "Bang Bang"; Dangerous Woman became her first of four consecutive number-one albums in the UK. 
           Personal struggles influenced her trap-infused fourth and fifth studio albums, Sweetener (2018) and Thank U, Next (2019), both of which were critical and commercial successes. 
           Sweetener won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, and Thank U, Next broke the record for the largest streaming week for a pop album and was nominated for Album of the Year.
           The singles "Thank U, Next", "7 Rings", and "Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored" made Grande the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the Hot 100 simultaneously and the first woman to succeed herself at the top of the UK Singles Chart. 
           Her 2020 collaborations "Stuck with U" with Justin Bieber and "Rain on Me" with Lady Gaga helped her break the record for most number-one debuts on the Hot 100, the latter winning the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.
           Grande's R&B-focused sixth studio album, Positions (2020), and its title track debuted at number-one in the UK and US.
           In 2021, she had her sixth US number-one single after featuring on the remix of The Weeknd's "Save Your Tears".
